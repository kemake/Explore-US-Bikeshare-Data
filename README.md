# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
The number of bike-sharing systems has grown over the past decade and is becoming more and more popular in cities around the world.The bike sharing system enables users to rent bicycles for a short period of time for a certain amount. Users can borrow a bike at A and return it at B, or they just want to ride it or return at the same location. Each bike can be used by multiple users per day.
This project will use Python to explore data related to bicycle sharing systems in three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York, and Washington, DC. Fuctions mainly involve:  Based on user input, it will return the following information:

1. Which month is most common in the Start Time column?
2. Of the starting times, which day of the week (such as Monday, Tuesday) is most common? 
3. Which hour of the day is the most common among the start times?
4. What is the total trip duration and how long is the average ride duration?
5. Which start station is the most popular and which end station is the most popular?
6. Which trip is the most popular (that is, which combination of starting and ending sites is the most popular)?
7. How many people are in each user type?
8. How many people are of each gender?
